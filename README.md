# Birthday-probability
This is a julia file using the PlotlyJS and CSV  libraries  which generates a heatmap showing the probability of being born in the USA on a given day

The Data  was taken from the CDC website each day of the year from 1969 to 1988. Inspired an excersise in the book 
"Learning Sccientifific programming with Python 2nd edition" by Christian Hill which I made in Julia code. 
The excersise can be found here:
